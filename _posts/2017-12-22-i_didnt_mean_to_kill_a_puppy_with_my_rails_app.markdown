Let me first explain the ominous title.

About 3 days into my Rails project I came across this article on Medium titled "[Every Time you Build a To-Do List App A Puppy Dies.](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/every-time-you-build-a-to-do-list-app-a-puppy-dies-505b54637a5d)."

Well.... sorry.  I was already knee-deep in.  What could I do?

I didn't choose to build "Simple Tidy" (a chore tracking app) to kill puppies, and I apologize if the market is oversaturated.  But you see, ever since I started this program at Flatiron the state of my apartment has been an absolute nightmare.  In my desperation, I remembered this housekeeping tip that my son's old home daycare teacher once told me about... "Make a list with Daily, Weekly, Chores.  Complete all the daily chores, and then do 1-2 Weekly chores and 1 Monthly chore a week.  Simple as that."

And let me tell you, this woman ran a home daycare with 8 kids by herself on a 5 acre farm with 4 children of her own and her house was IMMACULATE.  Every day it looked like it could be featured in "Better Homes and Gardens."

So I figured, if it works on paper, I could replicate it in app form with "Simple Tidy."

Full disclosure:  I did not plan on spending nearly 2 weeks on this app.  In fact, had I read the instructions a little bit better, I could have shaved off 3 days.  But I'm greatful for the rabbit holes I fell in as I think I revisited nearly every part of the Rails curriculum and have come out feeling much more confident in my newfound skills.

The one challenge that I beat my head on the longest was the requirement to pass user submitted params through a nested form that would modify an entry in my join table with a custom attribute writer.  I noticed this requirement in the process of submitting my project and ended up spending another day to redesign a portion of the app to accommodate the requirement.  Let that be a lesson to you all... ALWAYS CAREFULLY READ INSTRUCTIONS.

Exasperated, I ended up posting a [StackOverflow Question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47919684/grabbing-user-ids-through-a-nested-form-for-use-in-custom-attribute-writer) late at night, went to bed, dreamed that I'd woken up to a barage of helpful answers... but really woke up to zilch.  The answer eventually came to me after a million more google searches.  But whatevs... It's DONE(ish).
