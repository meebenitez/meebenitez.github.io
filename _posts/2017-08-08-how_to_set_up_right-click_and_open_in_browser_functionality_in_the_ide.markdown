Httpserver was often not super responsive for me and slowed down my iteration time, so I was thrilled when a Lean expert pointed me in the direction of an awesome little package called "Open-in-Browser" for atom.

This package allows you to view your html files locally by right-clicking on the file in the IDE tree and select "Open in Browser."

I've run into a small handful of people in the help box who didn't know about this handy feature, and after walking them through the install, I figured I could save a lot of time by just posting those instructions in my blog. 

So here you go...

1.  In the file menu of the IDE, select "Settings" (or, press Ctrl + Comma)
2.  Your main window will split in two.   At the bottom of the left pain, you'll see an "+ Install" option.  Select it!

3. This will bring up a window with a search bar in the right pane.  In the search bar, type in "Open in Browser" and hit Enter.

4. You'll now have a list of results from your search.  Scroll down to the package called "Open-in-browser" by user magbicaleman and select "Install"

And that's it!  You won't even need to restart the IDE.

Now, when you right click on an html file, you'll see an option to "Open in Browser."
