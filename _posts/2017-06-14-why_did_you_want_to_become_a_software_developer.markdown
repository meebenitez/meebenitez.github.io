There are two types of people in this world that I am most envious of:  polyglots and programmers.  

They both possess limitless freedom-- the polyglot to communicate, and the programmer to create.  The mental gap between me and “them” use to seem like lightyears, and thinking about it made me feel painfully average.

--------

Technically, I’ve been in “software development” for awhile.  Video game development, specifically.  I build virtual arenas where children and grown adults spend hours annihilating each other with pixel bullets and trash talk.  A classier way to put it would be “I design maps for war simulators.”

I’ve been doing it for 7 years, and I’ve had a decent amount of success.  It’s the job that helped me pay off my student loans, I get to be challenged creatively every day, and playing/making games for a living is genuinely fun.  

But now that I’m a mom, there’s this tinier, cuter version of me that I have to take care of.  And because my glamorous games job is still technically a “9 to 5”-er, that means the little tyke has to pull an “8 to 6” shift at daycare every day to accommodate my schedule. I realize that’s normal life for families with working parents, but maybe it doesn’t have to be normal for us.

I’ve always admired programmers (as I mentioned earlier).  I’ve always wished I had their superpowers.  I've worked alongside them in my current career.  But it was not until I “grew up” and had a kid that I, suddenly, had the drive and discipline to attempt to become one.

Being a programmer, in my mind, represents freedom.  It’s the freedom to come up with my own ideas and build them from scratch.  It’s the freedom to work for anyone (including myself), anywhere in the world (remote work!).  It's the freedom to "sell my product, not my time" so I can be around my son more.  When I think about what I could be doing as a software developer who programs, the scenarios are endless.

And now that I’m knee deep in the learning process and solving problems, I’m realizing becoming a programmer is an attainable goal that I’m already very passionate about.  I look forward to studying, and Code Wars katas have eaten up all my “gaming” time.  And I’m doing lots of research and creating lists of projects I want to build that I think will have a positive impact on society.

Who knows, if I conquer this goal, maybe I’ll also have the confidence become a polyglot. :)
